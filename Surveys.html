                <h1>Survey 1</h1>
                <p>In one of our surveys, the most essential question we asked was to <br>
                know how much people knew about the term "Indigenous Languages".<br> 
                Unfortunately, 83.4% of responders had no knowledge or very <br>
                little knowledge about the topic of our project. Using this <br>
                knowledge, we were able to plan and stream line our awareness <br>
                projects to aim for most people to gain enough knowledge to <br>
                care for languages as a whole</p>
                <h1>Survey 2</h1>
                <p>In our second survey, we questioned peoplle as to what they think makes indingenous languages important. As answers for this, <br>
                    we recieved one common answer, "Culture", however very few people were able to accurately explain. <br>
                    Hence, in all our presnetations we ensured that we explained how and to what extent do indiegnous languages affect culture and our indentity
